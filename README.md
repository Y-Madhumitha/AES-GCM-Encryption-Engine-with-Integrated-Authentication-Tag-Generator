# üîê AES-GCM Encryption Engine with Integrated Authentication Tag

This project implements a hardware-based AES-GCM encryption engine in Verilog with integrated authentication tag generation for secure data transmission. The design ensures *data confidentiality* and *integrity* in a single pass, making it highly efficient for real-time and high-security applications.

## üîç Project Overview

AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode) is a widely adopted cryptographic standard for authenticated encryption. This project involves the design, simulation, and verification of an AES-GCM engine that supports both *encryption* and *authentication tag generation* in hardware.
